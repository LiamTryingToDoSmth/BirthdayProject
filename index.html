<h1>-We are walking through a red forest, it is the season of autumn, red leaves are falling as we walk through.</h1>
&nbsp;

<p>Koko: Isn&#39;t it wonderful? We&#39;re finally together. I&#39;ve always dreamt of this. Huu, after all those stressful days, we&#39;re not in the real world yet but who knows, things could be exactly like this in the future.</p>

<h1>-After walking for a while, we&#39;ve reached to a view point. There is a river far away, a gentle breeze is blowing.</h1>

<p>Koko: I never want to let go of your hands. My dearest you know, I Love You more than everything. You&#39;re the best thing that has ever happened to me. Can we be like this forever Thae Thae? Maybe we can escape to somewhere away from everything. I just, I just want to be with you.</p>

<p>Koko: We&#39;ll have dogs and cats, we&#39;ll make a little garden in front of our house, I will cook you the meals you like to eat, gaze the stars at night, will be warm and cozy while covered in blanket in the rainy cold days, we will have kids, everything you can think of. Can we just be together, my Love?</p>

<p>Thae Thae:</p>

<h1>-We almost walked passed through the red forest and we are on our way to get out. We&#39;re on the edge of a hill, the endless mountains can be seen.</h1>

<p>Koko: Just how beautiful this scene is. This was the same view I could see everyday while I was in Thailand. Remember how I used to say like how I wanted to be together while sitting together watching that view? The view is already beautiful. But it is just more beautiful when you&#39;re with me together.</p>

<p>Thae Thae:</p>

<h1>-We&#39;ve left the forest, there is a beach at the end of the forest. We were walking along the beach, the gentle breeze blew.</h1>

<p>Koko: My mind is so calmed right now you know. It feels like peace, being with you. To be together is all I ever asked for. Thank you for existing my pretty girl.</p>

<p>After having lunch, we were sitting on a couch, doing nothing but enjoying each other&#39;s company, we are hearing the sound of sea waves, a gentle breeze is blowing. The endless view of the ocean is before us. I just love being like this. I wish this moment last forever. Waves of warmth, just passing through my whole body. I just want to cuddle with you like this forever.</p>

<p>Everytime I hear this song, &quot;Here With Me&quot;, I think of you. The lyrics goes</p>

<p>&quot;Watch the sun along the coast, as we getting old....I wish I can live through every memory again, just one more time before we float off in the wind, all the times we spent waiting for the light to take us in, have been the greatest moment of my life&quot;.</p>

<p>It makes me think about the time we&#39;ll be old. I would be reminiscing about the life we have and had together. Remembering all the details and things we went through, the time we had together, the memories, just unforgettable. I would give my everything to relive the life of us again if I had a chance. My wonderful girl, I&#39;m so much happy for the time we have now. I love you so much, I love you. Under the setting sun on this quite beach, there&#39;ll be just us, alone but not lonely. I&#39;ll hold you tight, my dearest.</p>

<p>The sun sets and the night comes. We&#39;re on the beach, under the countless stars, the Milky Way is looking us down form the above. We were always under the same sky, under the same stars, but we used to be thousands of miles away. And now that we&#39;re together, is it a dream? The calmness of the night, soothing sound of the sea waves, I can hear you breathing slowly. A gentle breeze blew through us. Just thinking, what else matters when I have you with me. What else matters. I sometimes wish, we can pause the time just right here, and be together forever. I don&#39;t care how long it takes, I&#39;ll come close to you. It will be okay nw. I promise you here, just like this view now, we&#39;ll also go watch Halley&#39;s Comet too. Let&#39;s be together for many more years. I Love You.</p>
